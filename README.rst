============
I have a lot of videos lying around that I would like to categorise.
The videos are 2 minutes long League of Legends highlights and most
of them are less than 50 MB large. They should be searchable by name,
date, champ (character im playing), friends (who's in the game with 
me) and custom tags (e.g. penta, quadra, escape).
